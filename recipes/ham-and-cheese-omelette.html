    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic ham and cheese omelette recipe is a staple for brunch or a quick and satisfying dinner. With its light and fluffy texture, melted cheese, and savory ham, it’s a dish that’s sure to please.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ham pieces (diced)</li>
        <li>3 medium fresh free-range eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cheddar cheese (shredded)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in an 8-inch skillet or omelet pan over medium heat. Add ham pieces and cook gently to warm through for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Break eggs into a small bowl. Gently mix with a fork. As mentioned above, do not whisk.</li>
        <li>Tip gently stirred eggs over ham in skillet over medium heat. Using a fork, gently move egg around pan, pushing cooked egg from the pan’s bottom and allowing uncooked, liquid egg to run into its place. Gradually, all the eggs will start to set.</li>
        <li>Immediately once egg starts to set, sprinkle cheese and stop stirring. Let omelet sit for about one minute for heat to start to reach cheese. Sprinkle over a tiny pinch of salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once cheese is starting to warm, take a spatula and carefully nudge omelet’s lower edge two-thirds of the way over.</li>
        <li>Take a warmed plate, hold skillet over plate, and gently tip pan away from you and roll omelet out and over onto plate, so the seam is underneath. This is easier to do than it sounds. Serve omelet immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use high-quality ingredients, including fresh eggs and real butter.</li>
        <li>Don’t overfill the omelet with cheese and ham, as this can make it difficult to fold and can result in a messy omelet.</li>
        <li>Don’t overcook the eggs; a slightly runny center is desirable.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
