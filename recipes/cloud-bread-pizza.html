    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cloud bread pizza is a low-carb, gluten-free, and protein-rich alternative to traditional pizza. It’s made by whipping egg whites with a small amount of flour and seasonings, creating a light, airy, and neutral-tasting crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large egg whites</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional seasonings (e.g., garlic powder, Italian seasoning)</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni or other desired toppings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. This may take around 5-7 minutes with an electric mixer or longer with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Add salt and optional seasonings to the egg whites and gently fold until combined.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Drop small spoonfuls of the egg white mixture onto the prepared sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the “cloud bread” is set and lightly golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the cloud bread from the oven and let it cool for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top each cloud bread with pizza sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni (or desired toppings).</li>
        <li>Return the cloud bread pizzas to the oven and bake for an additional 5-8 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use fresh egg whites for the best results. Avoid liquid egg whites from cartons, as they may not whip up properly.</li>
        <li>Don’t overmix the egg whites, as this can lead to a dense crust.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different seasonings and toppings to find your favorite combination.</li>
        <li>Cloud bread pizza is best served fresh, but it can be stored in an airtight container for up to 24 hours. Simply reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</li>
    </ul>
